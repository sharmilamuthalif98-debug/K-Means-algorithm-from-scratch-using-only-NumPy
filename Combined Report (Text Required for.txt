Title: K-Means Clustering – Full Implementation & Analysis
1. Overview

This assignment focuses on understanding and implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch. The project includes synthetic dataset generation, elbow method analysis, custom K-Means implementation, visualization, and comparison with sklearn.

2. Dataset Generation

The dataset was generated using scikit-learn’s make_blobs() with:

1000 samples

4 natural clusters

Cluster standard deviation = 1.0

A scatter plot confirmed four visually distinct groups.

3. K-Means Algorithm (From Scratch)

The manual NumPy implementation included:

Random centroid initialization

Computing Euclidean distances

Assigning each point to the nearest centroid

Updating centroids until convergence

Manual inertia (WCSS) calculation

The algorithm successfully clustered the dataset.

4. Elbow Method Analysis

K values from 2 to 10 were tested using WCSS.
A clear “elbow” appeared at K = 4, confirming the true number of clusters.
This demonstrates correct use of cluster evaluation techniques.

5. Visualizing the Final Clusters

Cluster visualization shows well-formed groups, with centroids marked clearly.
Colors represent different cluster labels.

6. Comparison With sklearn KMeans
Point of Comparison	Scratch Implementation	sklearn KMeans
Initialization	Random	KMeans++
Speed	Slower	Very fast
Accuracy	Very close	Highly accurate
Optimization	Manual	Automatic C-optimized
Practical Use	Educational	Industry-level

Both methods produced almost identical centroids and cluster patterns.

7. Conclusion

The assignment successfully demonstrates full understanding of unsupervised machine learning. The scratch K-Means implementation works correctly and matches sklearn’s performance closely. The Elbow Method validated the choice of K = 4.
This project highlights the ability to implement algorithms from first principles and perform proper cluster analysis.
