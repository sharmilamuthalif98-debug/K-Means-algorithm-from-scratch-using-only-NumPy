# K-Means-algorithm-from-scratch-using-only-NumPy
This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch using NumPy and validates it using synthetic data generated with make_blobs. The results are compared with scikit-learn’s KMeans, including Elbow Method analysis, cluster visualization, and centroid comparison
